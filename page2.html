      <p>
          Originally, every state liscensce plate began with a number, then had a dash, then a combination of letters and numbers. The number before the dash symbolized what county the car was from. With the
          rapid growth of cities in Nebraska, some counties (Douglas, Lancaaster, and Sarpy) have had to abandon the practice to allow for more possible plate combinations. The number on the plate corresponds
          to the number of vehicles in the county in 1922 , with the lowest numbered counties being the most vehicles in 1922.
